siblingsurvival
===============

Draft R package to accompany our article on estimating adult death rates from sibling history data.

TODO

- examples need to use the new `cell.config` parameter
- should move `occ.exp` into this package
- maybe also move `attributes.to.long` to this package?
- figure out how to get bootstrap to play well with sibling estimates
- write a function to conduct IC checks for ind and agg
