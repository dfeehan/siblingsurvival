\arguments{
\item{esc.dat}{Dataset with a row for each respondent X sibling X cell, likely produced by \code{\link{get_esc_reports}}}

\item{ego.id}{String with the name of the column in \code{esc.dat} containing the survey respondent's id}

\item{sib.dat}{Dataset with a row for each reported sibling, likely produced by TODO}

\item{sib.frame.indicator}{String with the name of the column in \code{sib.dat} containing a 0/1 coded variable indicating whether or not each sib is in the frame population}

\item{cell.vars}{a vector with Strings containing the names of columns in \code{esc.dat} identifying the cells to group reports by (typically age group, sex, time period)}

\item{weights}{String with the name of the column in \code{esc.dat} that has the survey weights}

\item{ind.vis.var}{String with the name of the column in \code{esc.dat} that has the individual visibility for each sibling; defaults to NULL. If NULL, the individual visibilities are calculated}

\item{discretize.exp}{Boolean for whether or not expsoure should be discretized. Not yet implemented.}
