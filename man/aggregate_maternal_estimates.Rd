\usage{
aggregate_maternal_estimates(estimates, ego.dat, sib.dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimates}{the output of \link{sibling_estimator}}

\item{ego.dat}{the prepped ego data}

\item{sib.dat}{the prepped sibling data}
}
\value{
either a tibble with the estimates aggregated across age groups
OR, if there are bootstrap results, then a list with three entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{point} - the point estimates (should be the same as running w/out bootstraps)
\item \code{boot_summ} - estimates w/ confidence intervals calculated from bootstrap reps
\item \code{boot} - results for each bootstrap rep
}

calculate total rate based on point estimates

\section{Details}{


This function aggregates age-specific maternal mortality quantities
like the maternal death rate or the pregnancy-related death rate.
It uses the age distribution of the survey respondents as the reference
population.

Note that this will only consider estimates for females aged 15-49,
as this is what makes sense for aggregating maternal estimates
