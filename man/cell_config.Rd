\item{start.obs}{the column name with the time observation started}

\item{end.obs}{the column name with the time observation ended}

\item{event}{the column name with the time of the event (e.g. date of death)}

\item{age.offset}{the column name with each sibling's offset for age (typically the date of birth)}

\item{time.offset}{the column name with each sibling's offset for time (often the date of the survey interview)}

\item{event.name}{\link{optional} name of the event (useful for maternal mortality)}

\value{
A \code{cell_config} object that can be passed into estimation functions to describe
the cells that estimates should be produced for.

\section{Details}{

\itemize{
\item Note that all of the parameters that require column names are expecting strings. These
column names refer to the dataset with one row for each reported sibling. This
isn't passed into this function, so this function can't check that these column names are valid.
\item \code{age.groups} can either be the output of one of the helper functions for creating age groups
(\code{make.age.groups} or \code{make.even.age.groups}), or it can be '1yr', '5yr', or '10yr' for standard
1, 5, or 10-year age groups ranging from 15 to 65, or '1yr_to50', '5yr_to50' for standard 1 or 5-year age
groups ranging from 15 to 49
\item \code{time.periods} can either be the output of \code{make.time.periods}, or it can be
'12mo_beforeinterview', '5yr_beforeinterview', or '7yr_beforeinterview' for time periods one,
five, or seven years before the interview date
\item \code{exp.scale} is a factor that is used to convert differences between dates into years;
this is usually 1/12, since the DHS reports times by month (eg Dec 2010 or Sept 1995). Differences
in dates are thus denominated in months, and need to be multiplied by 1/12 to convert them into years.
