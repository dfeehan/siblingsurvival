# siblingsurvival 0.3.0

## New features

* Added `add_maternal_deaths()` to classify sibling deaths as pregnancy-related
  or maternal based on DHS coding variables (`sib.died.pregnant`,
  `sib.time.delivery.death`, `sib.died.accident`).
* Added `aggregate_maternal_estimates()` to aggregate age-specific maternal
  mortality estimates across age groups using the respondent age distribution as
  weights. Supports both point estimates and bootstrap confidence intervals.
* Added `get_ego_age_distn()` (internal) to compute the weighted age distribution
  of survey respondents, used as the reference population for aggregation.
* Added `prep_nrsim_sib_histories()` to prepare non-DHS (NR-SIM style) sibling
  history data, alongside the existing `prep_dhs_sib_histories()`.
* Improved bootstrap performance in `sibling_estimator()` via matrix
  multiplication (`get_boot_ests_matrix()`), replacing a wide-dataframe approach
  and achieving substantial speed-ups for large bootstrap replicate counts.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed `aggregate_maternal_estimates()`, which was accidentally referencing
  package-level example objects (`ex.ego`, `ex.sib`) instead of the `ego.dat`
  and `sib.dat` arguments passed by the caller.

## Tests

* Added `tests/testthat/test_maternal.R` with tests covering
  `add_maternal_deaths()`, `get_ego_age_distn()`, and
  `aggregate_maternal_estimates()` (including bootstrap paths).
* Added `tests/testthat/test_prep_dhs_sib_histories.R` with smoke tests for
  `prep_dhs_sib_histories()`.

## Repository

* Renamed default branch from `master` to `main`.

# siblingsurvival 0.1.0
