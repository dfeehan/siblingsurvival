siblingsurvival
===============

Draft R package to accompany our article on estimating adult death rates from sibling history data.

TODO

- handle discretizing exposure
- maybe handle including ego in reports?
- add unit tests

WISHLIST

- shiny widget for sensitivity analysis?
- unit tests
- additional varmaps (right now, we only have DHS6); an up-to-date list of DHS versions and recodes is available [here](https://www.dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-dhsg4-dhs-questionnaires-and-manuals.cfm)


VIGNETTES

- producing estimates (mostly done)
- making a sibling dataset from a survey dataset (mostly done)
- IC checks (now in 'producing estimates', but maybe make a separate vignette?)
