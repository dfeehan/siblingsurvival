siblingsurvival
===============

Draft R package to accompany our article on estimating adult death rates from sibling history data.

TODO

- maybe also move `attributes.to.long` to this package? then show that step,
  i.e., creating sibling dataset
- write a function to conduct IC checks for ind and agg (see get_ec_reports)
- handle discretizing exposure
- add unit tests

WISHLIST

- shiny widget for sensitivity analysis?
- unit tests

VIGNETTES

- producing estimates (mostly done)
- making a sibling dataset from a survey dataset
- IC checks
