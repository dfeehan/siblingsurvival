siblingsurvival
===============

An R package to help estimate adult death rates from sibling history data.

This package accompanies [our article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12000).

TODO

- handle discretizing exposure
- maybe handle including ego in reports?
- add unit tests

TODO (VIGNETTES)

- producing estimates (mostly done)
- making a sibling dataset from a survey dataset (mostly done)
- IC checks (now in 'producing estimates', but maybe make a separate vignette?)


WISH LIST

- it would be nice to have a Shiny widget to help conduct sensitivity analyses
- we could always use more unit tests
- additional varmaps (right now, we only have DHS6); an up-to-date list of DHS versions and recodes is available [here](https://www.dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-dhsg4-dhs-questionnaires-and-manuals.cfm)
